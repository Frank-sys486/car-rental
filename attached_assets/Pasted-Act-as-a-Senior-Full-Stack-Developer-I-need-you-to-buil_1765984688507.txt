Act as a Senior Full Stack Developer. I need you to build a comprehensive Car Rental Management System MVP.

PROJECT ARCHITECTURE: "Simulation Mode"
This app is designed for a single business owner who acts as both the Admin and the Customer interface.
- There is NO Login Screen.
- Instead, implement a global "Role Context" with a Toggle Switch in the Navbar: [View as Customer] <-> [View as Admin].
- Default state on load: 'Admin'.

TECH STACK (Strict):
- Frontend: React (Vite) + Tailwind CSS.
- Backend Option A (Production): Supabase (Auth/Database).
- Backend Option B (Local Dev): Local Mock Data (JSON).
- Router: React Router DOM.
- Icons: Lucide React.
- Charts: Use a lightweight library or CSS Grid for the Gantt Chart.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: OFFLINE/LOCAL DEVELOPMENT
You must architect the data layer to support a "Mock Mode" for local development without Supabase.
1. Create a `services/api.js` abstraction layer.
2. Check an environment variable (e.g., `VITE_USE_MOCK=true`).
3. If true, return data from a local `mockData.json` file.
4. If false, fetch data from Supabase.
This allows the developer to run `npm run dev` and test the full flow immediately without setting up the database.

UI/LAYOUT BLUEPRINT (Specific Design Instructions):

1. LANDING PAGE (Home.jsx) - The "Split" Design
- Hero Section: A clean, modern hero with a high-quality placeholder background image of a car.
- The "Dual Action" Card: Floating in the center of the Hero, with two tabs:
  - Tab A "Check Availability": Inputs for Start/End Date + Big 'Search' Button.
  - Tab B "Browse Cars": A 'View All Vehicles' button.
- Mobile: Stack these elements vertically. Ensure buttons are "thumb-friendly" (min-height 48px).

2. FLEET CATALOG (Fleet.jsx) - The "Grid" View
- Layout: CSS Grid. Desktop = 3 cards/row. Mobile = 1 card/row.
- Component "CarCard":
  - Top: Image (Aspect ratio 16:9).
  - Middle: Model Name (Bold) + Transmission Badge ('Auto'/'Manual').
  - Bottom: Price (e.g., "₱1,500/day") on Left + "Book Now" button on Right.
- Logic: If status != 'available', gray out the card and disable the button.

3. ADMIN DASHBOARD (Dashboard.jsx) - The "Gantt" View
- Header: Stats row (Total Cars, Rented Today, Revenue Today).
- Timeline (Gantt Chart):
  - Y-Axis (Left): List of Car Models.
  - X-Axis (Top): Scrollable horizontal dates (next 30 days).
  - Data Bars: Render bookings as colored bars spanning start-end dates.
    - Use the vehicle's `color_hex` property for the bar background.
    - Display the `guest_name` inside the bar if space permits.
- Interaction: Clicking a bar opens a "Booking Details Modal" (Show Guest Info, ID Status, Buttons to Approve/Complete).

4. BOOKING FORM (Simulation Flow)
- When a user clicks "Book Now":
- Show form: Guest Name, Phone, Dates.
- ID Verification: File Input with a "Skip for now" button.
- Logic: If skipped, status = "Pending - ID Missing". If uploaded, status = "Pending".

DATA STRUCTURE (Supabase & Mock Schema):
- Vehicles: id, model, plate, daily_rate, transmission, color_hex (e.g., #FF5733), status (available/maintenance), image_url.
- Bookings: id, vehicle_id, guest_name, guest_phone, start_date, end_date, total_price, status (pending/confirmed/completed/cancelled), id_verified (boolean).

DOCUMENTATION DELIVERABLES:
1. Create a `README.md`: Explain the project purpose, the "Simulation" logic, and the folder structure.
2. Create a `LOCAL_SETUP.md`:
   - Step-by-step guide on how to run the app in "Mock Mode" (e.g., "Set VITE_USE_MOCK=true in .env").
   - Guide on how to switch to Supabase later (providing the SQL schema).

EXECUTION PLAN:
1. Scaffold the React + Vite app.
2. Create `mockData.json` with 5 dummy cars and 3 bookings.
3. Build the `api.js` layer to handle the Mock/Supabase switch.
4. Build the UI Components following the Blueprint above strictly.
5. Assemble the pages with the Role Toggle logic.
6. Generate the Documentation files.
